# ATPub v1 Documentation

ATPub is a decentralized identity verification protocol built on the AT Protocol ecosystem. It enables users to create cryptographically verifiable claims linking their AT Protocol DID to external accounts and identities across the entire digital landscape. Unlike centralized verification services, ATPub stores all claims and proofs as AT Protocol collections on usersâ€™ Personal Data Servers (PDS), ensuring user ownership and control over their verification data.
