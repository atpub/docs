*ATPub* is a **decentralized identity verification protocol** built on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) ecosystem. It enables users to create cryptographically verifiable claims linking their AT Protocol DID to external accounts and identities across the entire digital landscape. Unlike centralized verification services, ATPub stores all claims and proofs as AT Protocol collections on usersâ€™ [Personal Data Servers](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server) (PDS), ensuring user ownership and control over their verification data.

The system provides proof schemas for common verification methods while allowing client applications to implement their own validation logic and trust decisions, creating a truly decentralized web of verified identities.

## Features

- **Users own their data**: All verification claims and proofs are stored in AT Protocol collections on the user's own PDS
- **No central authority**: Each client application validates proofs independently using publicly available data
- **Flexible trust models**: Different applications can implement different validation standards and trust levels
- **Cryptographic integrity**: All claims are tied to the user's AT Protocol DID and can include cryptographic proofs
